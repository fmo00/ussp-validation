# Contributing to this repository

Welcome to the BR-UTM UAS Service Provider Test Suite Kit repository. Thank you for your interest in contributing to it!

In order to maximize the quality of contributions while keeping the time and energy spent by contributors and committers to a minimum, we kindly ask you to adhere to the practices described below.

## General principles

1. Any change to resources in this repository must be handled through a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

1. No PR on the master branch can be merged without being reviewed.

1. The master branch should remain stable at all times.

1. Contributions should generally follow the [style guide](./STYLEGUIDE.md).

1. The size of individual PRs is a key factor with respect to the quality and efficiency of the reviews. When [Large Contributions](#large-contributions) are required, they should be structured as a series of small and focused PRs. Here are some helpful references:
   - [Strategies For Small, Focused Pull Requests, Steve Hicks](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2021/03/09/strategies-for-small-focused-pull-requests/)
   - [The Art of Small Pull Requests, David Wilson](https://essenceofcode.com/2019/10/29/the-art-of-small-pull-requests/)

### Large contributions

Given the critical nature of the content of this repository, contributions require careful review. To ensure that large contributions don't have a negative impact on the quality of the reviews, the following steps help ensure your contribution gets merged progressively, maximizing knowledge sharing between contributors and committers.

#### Design document

Following the initial discussion, the next step will be to create a design document that provides a detailed description of the contribution and outlines clearly how it will integrate and interact with the existing components. The expected content of this design document includes a narrative, overall architecture description, sequence diagrams, and test plans

#### Work and PRs breakdown

Upon reviewing your design document, we may require you to break the contribution into smaller packages, allowing small PRs to be reviewed progressively.
